Installs [flox][flox-github] on GitHub Actions for the supported platforms:
Linux and macOS.

[flox][flox-website] is a command line tool that helps you **manage your
environments**. flox builds on top of the powerful ideas of [Nix][nix-website]
as well as making them accessible to everybody.


## ‚≠ê Getting Started

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repo with the following contents:

```yml
name: "CI"

on:
  pull_request:
  push:

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install flox
      uses: flox/install-flox-action@v1

    - name: Build
      run: flox build
```

### üöÄ Add caching for faster CI

Caching with flox can be achieved by configuring what is known as
`substituter`.

You can see in an example below how to configure your GitHub workflow to **push
build artifacts** to a remote location. In the case of this example it is an
AWS S3 Bucket. 

With caching configured all subsequent builds will be faster since flox does
not have to build them again.

See [nix help-stores][nix-help-stores] for more information on the supported
URIs.

```yml
name: "CI"

on:
  push:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install flox
      uses: flox/install-flox-action@v1
      with:
        substituter: s3://your-cache-here # see `nix help-stores` for supported uris
        substituter-key: ${{ secrets.FLOX_STORE_PUBLIC_NIX_SECRET_KEY }}
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

    - name: Build
      run: |
        flox build nixpkgs#hello

    - name: Cache
      run: |
        flox nix copy --to "$FLOX_SUBSTITUTER" -v nixpkgs#hello
```

## Use an alternative `flox` executable

You can override the default ( latest stable release ) executable for `flox`
by providing explicit URIs for either an alternative `floxpkgs` flake or
`flox` installable URI.

For example to use `flox` from a particular `floxpkgs` revision you could set

```yml
# ...<SNIP>...
jobs:
# ...<SNIP>...
    - name: Install flox
      uses: flox/install-flox-action@v1
      with:
        floxpkgs-uri: "github:flox/floxpkgs/7df34f186e0a93cc45f8d08c85705c2e18f2ef10"
```

Alternatively you can provide an installable URI for an alternative `flox`
package ( useful for working on development builds ) with the following:

```yml
# ...<SNIP>...
jobs:
# ...<SNIP>...
    - name: Install flox
      uses: flox/install-flox-action@v1
      with:
        # For a local checkout:
        flox-installable-uri: ".#flox"
        # For the pre-release:
        flox-installable-uri: "github:flox/floxpkgs#flox-prerelease.fromCatalog"
```
